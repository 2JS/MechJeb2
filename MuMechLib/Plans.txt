		Look for a 2D artist
	- Choose either a new GUIStyle or create one from scratch.
	- Customizable info-windows: make lists with all the variables/titles, and allow the user to build his own windows

* Add a system for ComputerModules to easily have in-VAB GUI windows
	- Maybe just a EditorGUI() in addition to WindowGUI()?

* Change (most) orbital operations to create maneuver nodes
