* Convert to PartModule
        - Turn MechJebCore into its own PartModule
	    - Are there any Part class callbacks we use that don't exist anymore in PartModule?
        - Turn the classes that handle part animations into separate PartModules


* Explicit support for third-party ComputerModules?

* New GUI
	- Protractor-like icon?
		Look for a 2D artist
	- Choose either a new GUIStyle or create one from scratch.
	- Customizable info-windows: make lists with all the variables/titles, and allow the user to build his own windows

* Add a system for ComputerModules to easily have in-VAB GUI windows
	- Maybe just a drawEditorGUI() in addition to drawGUI()?
        - Figure out good way to make sure settings are saved if they're modified in the editor
          (onPartUpdate/onPartFixedUpdate don't get called there, and that's where MechJebCore currently saves settings)

* Change (most) orbital operations to create maneuver nodes
        - Might want to have two modes: a full-auto mode (like now) and a mode that just creates maneuver nodes

* Make the Core control more streamlined, and add RCS translation control

* Allow a "no-autopilot" mode (enabled/disabled via part.cfg?)
        - Requires separating all autopilot functionality from information displays
            - Split Ascent Stats into its own ComputerModule
